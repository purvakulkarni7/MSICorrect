# MSICorrect

MSICorrect is a Java-based commandline tool that performs recalibration of mass spectrometry imaging datasets without the need of specifying a lock-mass value. The computational approach implemented in the tool generates a reference spectrum, termed here as a consensus spectrum, using all the spectra present in the dataset. This consensus spectrum is used as a reference spectrum to generate
